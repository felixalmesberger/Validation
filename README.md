This lib is made out of two parts

Validation:
A replacement for the static Validator extending its functionality to support errors, warnings and required properties and truly allow a mix of validation attributes and the IValidatableObject interface.

.NET provides us with Validator.TryValidate...
In certain situations it is not possible to fully validate an object. 

Validation.WinForms

Visualize the validation results on data bound controls without the need of implementing the INotifyDataError interface.
